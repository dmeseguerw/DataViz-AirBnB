#### About AirBnB
20 years ago, the hospitality industry consisted on booking only hotel or motel rooms, making it sometimes difficult to travel to cities with low offerings, or prices being ridiculously high. In 2007, the company AirBnB was founded in San Francisco, as a hospitality service that connects people who want to rent out their properties with people who are looking for accomodations. Ever since, AirBnB has grown to over 5 million hosts, with more than 1.5 billion guests, in almost every country in the world. The idea was simple but effective: creating a safe platform for people to show their places on rent and earn some income, and also for visitors to rent places that felt like "home" [^airbnb]. 

AirBnB's business model relies on a "sharing economy", by taking a cut everytime someone books a stay. One good aspect of this service is that it doesn't require hosts to pay to list their properties. Hosts can always list what they want and also set the price accordingly [^investopedia]. Also, moving on to the safety side, AirBnB provides some regulations on how both hosts and users should communicate, ensuring that everyone feels safe and there are no threats, which could result in booking cancellations or even blocking users. 


#### Introduction to Dataset

In this post, we'll be exploring AirBnB's data in Copenhagen at the moment of September 2023. This dataset includes an ample set of data ranging from hosts information and ratings, to accomodations information, type, ratings, and location. We'll perform a deep analysis to find interesting patterns, and provide external data to support our findings. A lot of questions can be asked and we'll try to answer some of them: why does certain neighborhoods have lower rentals than others? What are the pricest neighborhoods to rent in Copenhagen? What type of accomodations are usually offered? What is the relationship with pricing and ratings? What can we know about hosts in Copenhagen?

#### Neighborhood distribution

As a starter, we present a choropleth map that covers the distribution of rentals per neighborhood in Copenhagen, starting from green as the lowest up to red as the highest number. At a first glance, notice how 2 neighborhoods stand out as the ones with the highest number of rentals: Norrebro and Vesterbro-Kongens Enghave. According to .... provide a reference and something ......

On the other hand, notice the 4 neighborhoods with the least amount of rentals: Bispebjerg, Bronshoj-Husum, Vanlose, and Valby. An interesting question might jump from this: why are all these neighborhoods on the west part of the city? ..... FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING .....

#### Short break! 

Now we want to take a break from all this interesting stories. Feel free to play around with the following map containing markers for all AirBnB rentals in Copenhagen! You can filter out by neighborhoods, and zoom in to find interesting patterns, or even find if there are any rentals near your place. Maybe you'll decide to rent your place if you live in an area with a lack of rentals ðŸ˜Š
