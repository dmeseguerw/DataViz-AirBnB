### About AirBnB üè®üè†
20 years ago, the hospitality industry consisted on booking only hotel or motel rooms, making it sometimes difficult to travel to cities with low offerings, or prices being ridiculously high. In 2007, the company AirBnB was founded in San Francisco, as a hospitality service that connects people who want to rent out their properties with people who are looking for accomodations. Ever since, AirBnB has grown to over 5 million hosts, with more than 1.5 billion guests, in almost every country in the world. The idea was simple but effective: creating a safe platform for people to show their places on rent and earn some income, and also for visitors to rent places that felt like "home" [^airbnb]. 

AirBnB's business model relies on a "sharing economy", by taking a cut everytime someone books a stay. One good aspect of this service is that it doesn't require hosts to pay to list their properties. Hosts can always list what they want and also set the price accordingly [^investopedia]. Also, moving on to the safety side, AirBnB provides some regulations on how both hosts and users should communicate, ensuring that everyone feels safe and there are no threats, which could result in booking cancellations or even blocking users. 


### Introduction to Dataset ‚öôÔ∏è

In this post, we'll be exploring AirBnB's data in Copenhagen at the moment of September 2023. This dataset includes an ample set of data ranging from hosts information and ratings, to accomodations information, type, ratings, and location. We'll perform a deep analysis to find interesting patterns, and provide external data to support our findings. A lot of questions can be asked and we'll try to answer some of them: why does certain neighborhoods have lower rentals than others? What are the pricest neighborhoods to rent in Copenhagen? What type of accomodations are usually offered? What is the relationship with pricing and ratings? What can we know about hosts in Copenhagen? ü§î




### Room type analysis
The provided bar charts offer a detailed breakdown of various aspects of rental properties in Copenhagen, ranging from bedroom and bed distribution to bath facilities and room types. The majority of listings feature one bedroom, indicating a prevalence of smaller accommodations suitable for solo travelers or couples. Similarly, the bed distribution chart shows a dominance of properties with one bed, aligning with the bedroom data. The bath distribution highlights that most properties provide one bathroom, enhancing convenience for guests. Additionally, the room type distribution chart reveals that a vast majority of properties are entire homes or apartments, suggesting a preference among travelers for privacy and full amenities, with only a small percentage opting for private or shared rooms. These visuals collectively paint a comprehensive picture of the rental options available, showcasing preferences and trends within the Copenhagen housing market.

### Price analysis
In this elegant visualization, we delve into the pricing and rating landscapes of rental properties, captured through meticulously plotted histograms and a revealing scatter plot. The majority of properties boast near-perfect ratings, reflecting a market where excellence predominates and guest satisfaction is high. Turning to the price distribution, it‚Äôs a tale of affordability with most properties priced below 1,000 DKK, hinting at a diverse array of lodging options suitable for various budgets.

### Neighborhood analysis

As a starter, we present a choropleth map that covers the distribution of rentals per neighborhood in Copenhagen, starting from green as the lowest up to red as the highest number.

We introduce a choropleth map that vividly illustrates the distribution of rental properties across Copenhagen neighborhoods. The color gradient starts with green, representing areas with the fewest rentals, and progresses to red, indicating neighborhoods with the highest concentration of rentals. This visual tool offers a straightforward depiction of rental density across the city.

##### Trending neighborhoods

At a first glance, notice how 3 neighborhoods stand out as the ones with the highest number of rentals: **N√∏rrebro, Vesterbro-Kongens Enghave, and Indre By**. According to *S√∏lver* [^nghbs], these 3 neighborhoods, along with Frederiksberg, are the best in Copenhagen. They all offer a lot of entertainment, restaurants, bakeries, shops, and sightseeing. For instance, N√∏rrebro is recognized for its authentic and local Copenhagen atmosphere, with several Danish bakeries ü•ê and local designer shops üëó, while Indre By is renowned for its list of sightseeing attractions üß≥üèõÔ∏è, which can actually be seen on the map with the red markers ‚ùó [^landmarks].

In the realm of rental availability, over half of the landlords typically offer their properties just one month in advance. However, in our analysis, when filtering out listings available for fewer than 180 days, **Indre By** dramatically leads over **N√∏rrebro and Vesterbro-Kongens Enghave** in listing percentages. As Copenhagen's quintessential tourist heartland, **Indre By** is dense with must-see attractions and is ripe with properties designed for the traveler in mind. Here, savvy landlords prefer longer lease periods, capitalizing on the constant flow of tourists, unlike their counterparts in quieter residential areas. This trend underlines a clever strategy by Indre By property owners who are keen to optimize earnings all year round from the ever-present tourist buzz.

##### Harder to get to neighborhoods

On the other hand, notice the 4 neighborhoods with the least amount of rentals: **Bispebjerg, Br√∏nsh√∏j-Husum, Vanl√∏se, and Valby**. An interesting question might jump from this: why are all these neighborhoods on the west part of the city? Although these neighborhoods also offer a lot, there is a small issue in their location that probably makes people resist from renting their places: **less access to public transportation**.

If we observe the public transportation map of Copenhagen üöÑ[^transport], we can immediately notice something about the metro and the trains: most of the routes are located on the east part of the city. This is something interesting to note if you are planning on visiting Copenhagen. Even though there are a lot of bus routes and services offered in these neighborhoods, train and metro services are lacking, with most of them only having a couple of stops.


#### Short break! 

Now we want to take a break from all this interesting stories. Feel free to play around with the following map containing markers for all AirBnB rentals in Copenhagen! You can filter out by neighborhoods, and zoom in to find interesting patterns, or even find if there are any rentals near your place. Maybe you'll decide to rent your place if you live in an area with a lack of rentals üòä
